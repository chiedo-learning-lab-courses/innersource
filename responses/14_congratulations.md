# :tada: Congratulations

You finished this course. You can see a deployed version of our work together at [your new GitHub Pages site]({{ deploymentURL }}). Feel free to share this link directly with others, or you can save the resources in one of the following ways.

### Saving course resources

1. If you'd like to just save the contents to your machine, you can:
   - Use this shortcut link to [download the files]({{ downloadURL }})
   - Download the files by clicking on the **Code** tab, clicking on **Clone or download** and clicking **Download ZIP**
   - [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) to your machine
1. If you'd like to transfer the repository to an organization on GitHub:
   - If your organization is on GitHub.com, [fork it]({{ forkURL }})
   - If your organization is on GitHub Enterprise Server, [transfer the repository](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.2/admin/articles/moving-a-repository-from-github-com-to-github-enterprise)

I won't track any further events in this repository.

Your next steps are in the [Innersource learning path]({{ GITHUB_URL }}/{{ course.Owner.login }}/innersource:-theory-to-practice).
